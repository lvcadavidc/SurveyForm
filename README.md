# SurveyForm
This is a short survey form to practice our skills. This is the 1st project for fullstack development.

We choose to do this project to apply concepts like: models and forms objects creation, and make a data base with them. Connect an HTML template with a CSS file, and also to a Django project. It gives us as result the following form:

Here we apply the use of TextFields, ChoiceFields for a checkbox and radio buttons. As well a gently interface for the user to see and input the data. The manage of this web page is made with the 'admin' option of Django, that also let us include the new survey answers.

Is a simple project project to do, and we hope include more web apps ideas and projects in this repo :)
